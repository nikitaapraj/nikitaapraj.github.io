            Hi there! I am Nikita Apraj, a seasoned technical writer based near vibrant New York City. I am passionate about simplifying complex technical concepts into clear and concise documentation. Currently, I’m a Senior Technical Writer at Okta, Inc. where I lead pivotal documentation projects and design scalable content architecture for our help website. I’ve extensive experience in creating user-friendly help guides, crafting impeccable API reference docs, and enhancing UX through effective microcopy. My process optimizations have resulted in significant time savings. My toolkit includes MadCap Flare, DITA, XML, HTML, GitHub, single-sourcing, and more. I earned my MS in Technical Communication from NC State and BA in Journalism from Mumbai University.</p>

            Before dedicating my career to technical writing, I worked as a journalist where I authored highly technical features and articles on Information Technology and nutrition science. I also worked as a translator and localization expert, bridging language barriers by translating software UI and clinical documents into Indian languages. In my spare time, I mentor aspiring technical writers and volunteer as a judge at the Society for Technical Communication for their annual technical writing contest.
